<p>
This was such an emotional movie for me, I cried a lot during this movie.

<h3>Barbie</h3>

<p>
Barbie was definitely my favorite doll, and the movie was iconic to say
the least.<br/>
A feel good movie, with fun music, colors, 
not to mention choreographies.

<h3>Girl interrupted</h3>

<p>
Angelina Jolie's character is so unhinged, and yet sad, but especially so compelling to watch. The story is really good and I heard it takes 
after another movie from the 70s, so I definitely wanna watch that too.
